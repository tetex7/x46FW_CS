Well I'm taking a *Linux* approach to it; a variant is like a *distro* it varies if you get what I'm saying. 
There's a variant for ***RobotC*** which will be coming to GitHub soon. 
And Iâ€™m making a variant for **VEX** robotics ***V5*** which will be proprietary for reasons of competition To finish variant **ROOT** is the master variant.
PS ***there shall not be a variant for the Standard C Language***
